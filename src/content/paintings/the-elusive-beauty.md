<p>To create this picture, I was inspired by a flower that was already at the final stage of its beauty, but how charming it was! Here I drew a parallel for myself with the maturity of people. If a person lives life living in the moment, accepting being and with gratitude to space, trying to do everything out of love, then his appearance at any age is beautiful and effective.</p>
