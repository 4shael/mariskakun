<p>In this piece, the artist explores the elusive dance of emotions and reality. Using oil and pastel, she weaves abstract forms and expressive strokes to visualize the intangible—feelings, thoughts, and fleeting moments. Inspired by the mountains and nature, she aims to convey the energy of these majestic landscapes through a visual code that reflects her inner experiences.</p>
<p>The soft palette creates an atmosphere of calmness and introspection, inviting viewers to delve into their own experiences of existence and emotion.</p>
