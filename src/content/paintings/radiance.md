<p>This painting was created by artist Mari Skakun during the winter months, when daylight becomes scarce, and the craving for color feels almost physical. Immersing herself in the luminous interplay of pink and yellow, the artist sought not only visual but also emotional intensity, capturing the energy of light—its vibration, joy, and euphoria.</p>
<p>Mari Skakun’s visual language is a dialogue between expression and subtle sensitivity. Her works are built on the collision of impulsive, fragmented yet rhythmic lines with delicate color gradations that create depth and a shimmering effect. Layers of acrylic and wax crayons interact like recorded movements on the canvas, capturing not so much form as the pulsating dynamics of emotion.</p>
<p>This piece will transform a space, filling it with light and creating an atmosphere of warmth and radiance. It will not merely complement an interior but redefine it, infusing it with the energy of pure color and expressive gesture. Feel the vibration of color.</p>
<p>For safe and comfortable delivery, the painting is not stretched on a frame. After purchase, it will need to be framed at a framing workshop. This is an inexpensive procedure.</p>
