<p>This painting was created in Goa. I was simply watching the waves of daylight — how it plays, how it shimmers, how it changes. And at some point, I realized that this is exactly what I wanted to capture — not a subject, not an object, but this very feeling. A state of lightness, carefree joy, and relaxation that I was living through at the time, and that now lives on in this work.</p>
<p>I love watching the play of sunlight — the way it lands on everything around, leaving behind soft highlights, shadows, glimmers. These are natural, everyday processes, nothing extraordinary, but there is absolute beauty in them.</p>
<p>This is the state I wanted to convey. The painting feels like an invitation to pause, to freeze for a moment, to stop rushing — and just look. Look and feel.</p>
