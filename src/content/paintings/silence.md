<p>I&#8217;ll tell you a little about the history of creation of the painting &#8220;Silence&#8221;.<br />
In 2015 and 2016, my friends and I went to Goa to warm up and enjoy the ocean. We tried not to miss a single sunset and sunrise. To meet the sun, we always went to the Seolim Bridge, the color of the sky and the air were lilac-pink. The sun was in no hurry to wake up and the sky seemed to merge with the water into a single stunning haze. I tried to convey this mood, the magic of the moment in this picture in order to periodically look and dive in.</p>
