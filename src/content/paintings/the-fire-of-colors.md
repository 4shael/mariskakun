<p>This canvas, painted in oil, was created on a September evening in a park near the Château de Rambouillet. The artist was inspired by nature in its autumn splendor, as the soft light of the setting sun bathed the leaves in warm tones. Working from life, the author sought to capture not only the outer appearance of the plants but also their inner energy. The oil painting technique allowed for a rich color palette and smooth transitions between shades, enhancing the evening atmosphere when nature seems to pause in anticipation of the night, while still retaining its lush beauty.</p>
<p>The special value of this painting lies in the fact that it was painted from life, allowing the artist to capture the uniqueness of the moment, frozen in a harmony that will never be repeated in the same way again.</p>
