<p>In this work, Mari Skakun continues to develop her distinctive visual code, where the energy of the brushstroke, the glow of color, and the fluidity of lines create a unique rhythm balancing spontaneity and precision.</p>
<p>“Secret Garden” is the radiance of spring, the joy that lingers in the air, and a tender corporeality unfolding through the movement of color. The pink glow seems to pulsate, intertwining with warm apricot, honey, and lilac tones. The lines, light and almost elusive, guide the eye through layers of emotions and sensations, inviting the viewer into an intimate space where reality merges with a dream.</p>
<p>In this piece, the artist explores sensitivity and the delicacy of perception, allowing the viewer not only to see but to feel the warmth, lightness, and magic of life hidden within the ethereal shades of a spring garden.</p>
<p>This is a one of a kind painting, an absolutely unique creation by me, Mari Skakun<br />
Unframed. In situ images for illustration purposes only.<br />
Due to its large size, the artwork will be shipped rolled to make the delivery more convenient and cost-effective.</p>
