<p>The painting, done in oil on black paper, depicts a sleeping woman lying with her legs spread. The dark background creates a dramatic contrast, highlighting the delicate lines of her body and conveying a sense of calm and vulnerability. The colors gently blend, playing with light and shadow, adding depth to the image and giving the figure an almost sculptural quality. The overall tone of the work evokes a sense of intimacy and mystery.</p>
