<p>In creating this artwork, I delved deeply into the abstract and expressive realms, using oil, oil pastel, and colored pencils to weave a tapestry of emotions on paper. The flowing lines and vibrant forms represent the complexities of human emotions and connections. Each stroke and color choice embodies a piece of a larger emotional narrative, inviting viewers to explore the depths of their own feelings. This artwork is meant to provoke reflection and add a dynamic, thought-provoking element to any space.</p>
