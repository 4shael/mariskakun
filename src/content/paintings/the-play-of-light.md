<p>In “The Play of Light”, Mari Skakun reveals her unique visual code, exploring the interplay of light, movement, and color. Created en plein air in Goa, this work captures the ever-changing dance of sunlight on palm leaves. For the artist, this act of observation is not merely a moment of fixation but a painterly investigation into the very nature of light itself.</p>
<p>Combining oil and oil pastel, Mari creates a sense of continuous motion. Her energetic brushstrokes and expressive lines do more than depict visual impressions—they capture the breath of nature, its rhythms, and its pulses. The flexible canvas (58×84 cm) serves as a membrane, absorbing and transforming light into a vibrant pictorial language.</p>
<p>“The Play of Light” is an invitation to contemplation. The painting transcends the traditional landscape, evolving into a dialogue with the viewer, an attempt to convey something intangible—something that often escapes the eye. This is the essence of Mari Skakun’s work: they do not merely depict nature, but speak in its very language.</p>
