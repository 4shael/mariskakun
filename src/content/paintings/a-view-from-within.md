<p>“’A View from Within’ is an attempt to convey the inner world through abstract forms and lines, to show how I perceive space, emotions, and thoughts within myself. These flowing, winding lines seem to reflect the movement of consciousness, its chaos and, at the same time, harmony. I worked on each element for over 40 hours, striving to capture the moment when the external connects with the internal, when sensations become visual forms.</p>
<p>Each shape and color is a metaphor for feelings and impressions. The red and orange bursts represent energy, sexuality, and internal impulses, while the softer pastel tones symbolize calmness, reflection, and a deep connection with oneself. The lines, like threads, link the elements, creating invisible connections between feelings and thoughts, between body and mind.</p>
<p>‘A View from Within’ is not just a painting, it is a visual diary of emotions, streams of consciousness, and self-reflection, which I reveal to the world, allowing the viewer to glimpse into my inner world.”</p>
<p>The artwork is created with high-quality oil paints on canvas.<br />
