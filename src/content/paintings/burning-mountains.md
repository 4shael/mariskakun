<p>Burning mountains. Mountains that I painted from life in Montenegro during the late sunset.<br />
In this fervent landscape, I&#8217;ve unleashed my innermost passions through the vivid interplay of oil and pastel. Evocative of nature&#8217;s raw power, I&#8217;ve sculpted the canvas with explosive hues that ignite the mountains, infusing them with life. The fluid strokes and rich texture embody the untamed spirit of the wilderness, a striking reminder of the Earth&#8217;s fiery heart. This piece is meant to evoke a sense of wonder and vitality, bringing a dynamic surge of energy into any space.</p>
