<p>“The Dance of Hidden Shadows in the Mystical Forest of the Unconscious” is a work by Maria Skakun, created in her signature technique.<br />
The painting was crafted over the course of several months, allowing the artist to deeply immerse herself in the process and refine every detail.</p>
<p>Mari delves into the depths of her unconscious, exploring the interplay with the shadow aspects of personality. By working with emotions often hidden from view — sadness, aggression, and fear — she crafts a space where these feelings find form and meaning.</p>
<p>Through her unique visual code, Maria conveys the atmosphere of a mysterious forest where shadowy entities and inner experiences intertwine in a dance. Each brushstroke and line on the canvas serves as a tool for profound self-exploration. The painting reveals a world where the unconscious unfolds in the form of hidden shadows, transforming into an integral part of inner harmony.</p>
<p>This piece invites viewers to engage in a dialogue with their own shadows, inspiring self-acceptance and turning complex emotions into a source of strength and growth.<br />
It is recommended not to hang this painting opposite a window, as sunlight may significantly mute the dark shades.</p>
