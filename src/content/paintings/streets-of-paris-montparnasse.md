<p>I was sitting in a cafe, drawing the life of Parisians.<br />
This is a sketch from a notebook, made on two pages. which, when sent to you, I will accumulate onto one sheet of paper so that the picture looks complete. but the seam will still be visible, this is the charm of sketching on the street</p>
