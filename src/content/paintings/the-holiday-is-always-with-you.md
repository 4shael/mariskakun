<p>In this piece, I&#8217;ve melded the raw emotions of expressionism with the depth of abstraction. Using a blend of acrylic, oil, oil pastel, and spray, along with everyday objects, I created a vivid, energetic composition that captures a distinct moment of emotional release. The word &#8220;Merde&#8221; emerges in vibrant, glittering hues against a tumultuous, dark background, symbolizing beauty and chaos coexisting. This artwork invites viewers to find allure amidst disorder, adding a spirited vibe to any space.</p>
