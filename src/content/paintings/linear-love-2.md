<p>This graphic explores the theme of connection between two energies, conveying their interaction through delicate, flowing lines. The faces are not separated by distinct boundaries, symbolizing deep closeness, where each remains unique but opens up to the other.</p>
<p>The bright accents of yellow, pink, and orange reflect the emotional exchange and passion that emerge in such moments. This piece is about the subtle, invisible interaction happening on the level of feelings and energy, where words are no longer necessary.</p>
