<p>I painted these flowers in the last days of February from life, in anticipation of March. When everything blooms again and the heart opens to something new.</p>
<p>In creating this piece, I embraced the essence of expressionism, pouring vivid emotions onto the canvas. The oil and pastel blend together, crafting a vibrant dance of color and texture that brings the figurative bursts of life into any space. This painting celebrates nature’s lively chaos, a symphony of growth, and raw beauty, meant to invigorate and inspire every viewer with its dynamic presence.</p>
