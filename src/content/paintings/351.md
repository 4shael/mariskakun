<p>“Immersive exhibition LABYRINTH BARDO” &#8211; a combination of music, painting, VJ and poetry. It is designed as a two-story maze.<br />
Six black rooms with paintings inside. The paintings are accompanied by music and poems, under which they were written.<br />
You can listen to the works through your own headphones.<br />
BARDO is a concept in Tibetan Buddhism that means “transition” or the gap between the completion of one<br />
situation and the beginning of another. The transition from one room to another symbolizes the six BARDO states: the process of dying, nonexistence, birth, life, sleep and meditative concentration.</p>
