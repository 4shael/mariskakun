<p>This painting, as an empirical experience, was born from the influence of attending the Ozora Festival of psychedelic music, where sound and nature united people in a powerful energetic flow.<br />
It is dedicated to absolute love, emotional and physical intimacy, the connection between masculine and feminine, and the mystical interaction of energies.</p>
<p>The painting’s visual code is rich in symbols and nuances, highlighting the fine line between the physical and the spiritual. Abstract forms and soft, flowing colors—mainly pastel pinks and blues—convey a sense of lightness and harmony. Vibrant accents, like bold red and orange lines, add dynamism and depth—like a reflection of life itself, pulsing to the rhythm of emotions. Smooth contours of figures flow into one another, symbolizing unity and the balance of energies.</p>
<p>I recommend viewing this painting with your heart and emotions, feeling the vibrations of color and paying attention to any associations that arise.</p>
<p>What do you feel when looking at this interplay of forms and shades? Perhaps the painting will reveal something new about your own relationship with the concepts of closeness and unity.</p>
<p>The artwork is created with high-quality oil paints on canvas.<br />
