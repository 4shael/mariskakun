<p>The Lost Garden</p>
<p>140 × 170 cm<br />
<span style="font-size: 1.125rem">Acrylic, oil, wax pastel on canvas</span></p>
<p>This painting was born out of the early days of spring—when nature begins to awaken, open, and hum with vibrant energy. The Lost Garden is a metaphor for an inner space that had long remained hidden but suddenly began to bloom, breathe, and come alive. Flowing forms and luminous colors evoke movement, sensuality, feminine energy, and a gentle sense of unfolding. It is a deeply personal place the artist has rediscovered—and now invites the viewer to step inside.</p>
