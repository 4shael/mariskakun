<p>I painted this painting as a desire to capture a brief moment in the year when mimosa blooms.</p>
<p>I bought mimosa for myself at the French market and went to paint it.</p>
<p>It gives me a feeling of freshness and joy with its color and scent, filling the entire house. It creates a sense of an imminent encounter with spring. I wanted to capture all of this in my expressive style of oil painting, so that these emotions would remain permanent.<br />
The painting was done from life.</p>
